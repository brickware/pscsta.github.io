Nearly 20 PSCSTA members and other local CS educators joined us for this session where attendees were challenged to reflect on their teaching practices and how we all could work to create safe and equitable learning environments for all our students. Attendees participated in discussions about their own experiences with equity, how they deal with issues of diversity in their classes, and what techniques can be useful in responding to different situations and scenarios. Said one workshop attendee: &#8220;It was amazing to get to discuss these issues with fellow educators and learn about the unique circumstances we each face in our classrooms. I definitely have a lot of new ideas for how I can create a more inclusive space for my students.&#8221;</p>

Where: Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science &#038; Engineering (CSE) Gates Commons (6th floor)<br />
Registration: <a href="https://pscsta-jan2018.eventbrite.com">https://pscsta-jan2018.eventbrite.com</a></p>
<p>This workshop, run by Crystal Hess, is designed to engage critical thinking about how to build a collaborative learning community in the classroom that focuses on advocacy for students from marginalized or underserved populations.</p>
<p>Participants will engage in activities, discussion, and reflection to generate critical thinking about how can they, as educators, act/react to create a safe and equitable learning environment for our students. Participants gain common vocabulary about equity (privilege, bias, and allyship) and participate in discussions about how each of these can effect a studentâ€™s ability to engage in learning in the classroom and to feel belonging in to a collaborative learning community (particularly those students you are traditionally underserved or marginalized). Participants will work through example inequity scenarios, discuss solutions with their peers, and practice responses that create a safe and equitable learning experience for their students.</p>
<p>NOTE: Participants will be required to do an hour of pre-work consisting of groundwork for discussions in the sessions including reading supplied articles and completing supplied activities as well as reflecting on those experiences before coming to the workshop.</p>
<p>Participants who complete the pre-work and the 2 hour workshop will be eligible to receive 3 regular clock hours (sponsored by PSCSTA and the UW Dawgbytes program) (pending approval from WSTA, but we donâ€™t think it will be a problem). Please email csta.pugetsound@gmail.com if you would like to receive clock hours for this event.</p>
<p>Event Schedule:<br />
12:00 &#8211; Arrive/socialize (Parking is free on campus after noon)<br />
12:30 &#8211; 2:30: Workshop<br />
2:30 &#8211; Time to continue discussion or to socialize</p>
<p>About the facilitator: Crystal Hess is a tenure-track Computer Science Instructor at Shoreline Community College. She previously taught both High School and was most recently Program Director at Ada Developers Academy (a coding bootcamp in Seattle for women and gender diverse people). She is most passionate about creating an equitable, safe, and fun learning experience for all students (especially the underserved) in the intro sequence (CS0 and CS1 in particular) and creating communities where people feel supported and connected (both students and educators).</p>
