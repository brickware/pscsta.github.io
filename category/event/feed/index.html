								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PSCSTA is thrilled to have hosted Crystal Hess, Computer Science Instructor at Shoreline Community College, for her workshop entitled &#8220;Teaching Diverse Students with a Lens on Equity&#8221; on January 20. Nearly 20 PSCSTA members and other local CS educators joined us for this session where attendees were challenged to reflect on their teaching practices and how we all could work to create safe and equitable learning environments for all our students. Attendees participated in discussions about their own experiences with equity, how they deal with issues of diversity in their classes, and what techniques can be useful in responding to different situations and scenarios. Said one workshop attendee: &#8220;It was amazing to get to discuss these issues with fellow educators and learn about the unique circumstances we each face in our classrooms. I definitely have a lot of new ideas for how I can create a more inclusive space for my students.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to learn more about the workshop, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NRvopXjYwzrHy_F6RIUOyI6pmeC3BlHqni0ke6IUXcc/edit?usp=sharing" target="new">view the slides</a> or <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/crystaljhess" target="new">contact Crystal</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to Crystal Hess for facilitating the workshop, Lauren Bricker for organizing, and the University of Washington for providing space. Thanks also to Jeremy Munroe for helping to make clock hours available to those who attended the workshop.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When: Jan 20, 12:00 (arrive and socialize), 12:30-2:30 for program with more social time at the end<br />
Where: Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science &#038; Engineering (CSE) Gates Commons (6th floor)<br />
Registration: <a href="https://pscsta-jan2018.eventbrite.com">https://pscsta-jan2018.eventbrite.com</a></p>
<p>This workshop, run by Crystal Hess, is designed to engage critical thinking about how to build a collaborative learning community in the classroom that focuses on advocacy for students from marginalized or underserved populations.</p>
<p>Participants will engage in activities, discussion, and reflection to generate critical thinking about how can they, as educators, act/react to create a safe and equitable learning environment for our students. Participants gain common vocabulary about equity (privilege, bias, and allyship) and participate in discussions about how each of these can effect a student’s ability to engage in learning in the classroom and to feel belonging in to a collaborative learning community (particularly those students you are traditionally underserved or marginalized). Participants will work through example inequity scenarios, discuss solutions with their peers, and practice responses that create a safe and equitable learning experience for their students.</p>
<p>NOTE: Participants will be required to do an hour of pre-work consisting of groundwork for discussions in the sessions including reading supplied articles and completing supplied activities as well as reflecting on those experiences before coming to the workshop.</p>
<p>Participants who complete the pre-work and the 2 hour workshop will be eligible to receive 3 regular clock hours (sponsored by PSCSTA and the UW Dawgbytes program) (pending approval from WSTA, but we don’t think it will be a problem). Please email csta.pugetsound@gmail.com if you would like to receive clock hours for this event.</p>
<p>Event Schedule:<br />
12:00 &#8211; Arrive/socialize (Parking is free on campus after noon)<br />
12:30 &#8211; 2:30: Workshop<br />
2:30 &#8211; Time to continue discussion or to socialize</p>
<p>About the facilitator: Crystal Hess is a tenure-track Computer Science Instructor at Shoreline Community College. She previously taught both High School and was most recently Program Director at Ada Developers Academy (a coding bootcamp in Seattle for women and gender diverse people). She is most passionate about creating an equitable, safe, and fun learning experience for all students (especially the underserved) in the intro sequence (CS0 and CS1 in particular) and creating communities where people feel supported and connected (both students and educators).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend, we hosted our second Programming Contest of the school year at the <a href="http://www.livingcomputermuseum.org/" target="_blank">Living Computer Museum</a>. In total ~200 students participated (in grades 8 &#8211; 12) on 85 teams! This event was made possible with the dedication of our Programming Contest Committee which was lead by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurenbricker" target="_blank">Lauren Bricker</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/frances-davies/aa/835/339" target="_blank">Frances Davies</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/michael-johnson/1/b89/2b0" target="_blank">Michael Johnson</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/brian-sea/9/775/53" target="_blank">Brian Sea</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/justin-spielmann/74/b91/139" target="_blank">Justin Spielmann</a>. We also are very thankful for the 30 industry volunteers who served as judges in the contest.</p>
<p>All photos of the event are now posted on our <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pscsta/sets/72157651749200487/" target="_blank">flickr page</a>!</p>
<p>The contest started with a Tech Panel of industry professionals that work in Computer Science fields related to Security. The video of this panel will be posted soon.</p>
<p>The winners of the advanced division were</p>
<ul>
<li>1st place: 2sly4you from Garfield High School (earning 835 points in 2:45:43)</li>
<li>2nd place: Sirius Cybernetics from MercerIsland High School (earning 780 points in 2:42:53)</li>
<li>3rd place: Complexity from Interlake High School (earning 780 points in 2:53:43)*</li>
</ul>
<p>The winners of the intermediate division were</p>
<ul>
<li>1st place: Eastlake High from Eastlake High School (earning 775 points in 2:32:47)</li>
<li>2nd place: Polar Vortex from Tahoma High School (earning 720 points in 2:29:12)</li>
<li>3rd place: ! from Seattle Preparatory School (earning 660 points in 2:59:00)</li>
</ul>
<p>* We regretfully had some miscommunication with a judge in the advanced division. Corrections to the Bank Street Writer were not communicated to the judge which resulted in two teams not receiving these corrections. We apologize greatly to the teams impacted, which included Complexity from Interlake High School. If they had received these corrections they may have been able to place higher in the standings.</p>
