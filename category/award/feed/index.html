								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each year, NCWIT (National Center for Women &#038; Information Technology) recognizes young women across the US for their interest and participation in computing.  Last year, the national winner was one of Lauren Bricker&#8217;s students from Lakeside!  We also had several runner-ups from the Puget Sound area.  Let&#8217;s make sure our outstanding Puget Sound girls are recognized again this year!</p>
<p>The award application opens September 15th and will close October 31st.  Please encourage your students to apply.  The big new thing this year is that there will be a local competition for Washington state.  This means that more students around the area will win great prizes including laptops, scholarships and cash.</p>
<p>To promote the award, NCWIT has provided a <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/pdf/AspAward_PromotionPosters09_FINAL.pdf">small poster</a> you can print yourself and an <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/pdf/AwardOnePager.pdf">information sheet</a>.  You can also request a full-size poster by mail <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/PosterRequest">here</a>.</p>
